# Containerization - Hands on session for docker
EMSE Docker tutorial

To have all aligned up and ready to go, I send you some short
introductory videos. Please install the software and try them out. If
you have Issues, contact me BEFORE the tutorial
(florian.hofer@stud-inf.unibz.it). I would like to have you all on
track, so you can use these tools in your accustomed environment and in
a productive way during the tutorial.

If you wish, you can then tryout a bit yourself, starting with a
beginner tutorial here
https://github.com/docker/labs

This three level tutorial introduces to the use of Docker as in the following:

* Container creation, poms one and two
* Containers in composition
* Personanlized use of containers

Each of them comes in a folder with step by step insttrucions, as well as the finised file. Try it out yourself first, make the experience. If you have issues, consult the final version.

It is not intended to be eaustive. Like with every other tool, the features you need depend a lot on the use you make of it.
